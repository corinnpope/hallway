<h3 id="three-questions-for-you">Three questions for you:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do all members of your team know who everyone is, what they do, and what they&rsquo;re like?</li>
<li>How long does it take your new team members to catch on to your company&rsquo;s culture?</li>
<li>How many of your employees have a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/511/item-10-best-friend-work.aspx">best friend</a> at work?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-would-happen-if">What would happen if:</h3>

<ul>
<li>You could build trust and loyalty between team members in a few minutes a week</li>
<li>Your team was more engaged in their work and happier to come to work.</li>
<li>You could help people understand and get &ldquo;in&rdquo; to the culture or your organization faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not possible, you say. Welp, the nice folks at Hallway think it is!</p>

<h3 id="that-would-mean">That would mean</h3>

<ul>
<li>Happier, more engaged employees</li>

We promise.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-the-story-behind-hallway">What&rsquo;s the story behind hallway?</h3>

<p>After being onboarded to a remote company, our founder found herself feeling socially isolated from the rest of her teammates. Her introversion made it uncomfortable to reach out to people she didn&rsquo;t know, so instead just did her work, sometimes not talking to anyone but her cat all day.</p>

<p>As happy as she was to have a remote position, she still missed that small group comaraderie felt at more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; jobs. As a way to improve her relationships with teammates, she built Hallway in her free time and turned a good job into a great job. After all, remote doesn&rsquo;t have to mean isolated.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-the-ideal-user-of-hallway">Who is the ideal user of Hallway?</h3>

<p>We would describe the ideal user of Hallway as an organization having between 50 and 200 employees, with a number of teams of multiple sizes. If you have an office, some employees are not always in the office, work out of different offices or floors, and some may work remotely. You&rsquo;re at the point where company culture may be difficult to communicate - so it&rsquo;s trial-by-fire for new recruits. You want your employees to enjoy coming to work, and you want to promote a connected team culture.</p>

<h3 id="when-are-you-guys-planning-on-launching">When are you guys planning on launching?</h3>

<p>Our goal is to get 10 good-fit customers in to our early alpha group. Once we&rsquo;ve got a solid product, we&rsquo;ll release the beta version, and then open it up to the general public. To be added to the list, add yourself to the list below, or send an email to corinn@hallwayapp.com.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-expected-from-beta-users">What&rsquo;s expected from beta users?</h3>

<p>All we ask is of our early users and beta users is that you send us feedback on the product and alert us to any bugs you find. In exchange, you&rsquo;ll be able to:
- Get your opinion out there and be heard.
- Lock in your rate. It wonâ€™t go up on you. For forever.
- Be entered in our drawing to win a free lifetime subscription.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-is-it-going-to-cost">How much is it going to cost?</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re offering special locked-in pricing of $49/month for teams on our beta list. We will be raising this price and creating additional, more expensive tiers for the public after our beta users have put the software through its strides.</p>

<h2 id="sound-good">Sound good?</h2>

<p>Hallway is still in development, but will be ready soon. Sign up below for early access when we&rsquo;re ready.</p>
