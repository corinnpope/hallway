# What is Hallway?
Hallway helps you know your team. [Request a beta invite here.](http://eepurl.com/cUSRq5)

### Three questions:
- Do all members of your team know who everyone is, what they do, and what they're like? 
- How long does it take your new team members to catch on to your company's culture?
- How many of your employees have a [best friend](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/511/item-10-best-friend-work.aspx) at work?

### What would happen if:

- Your team was more engaged in their work and happier to come to work.
- You could help people understand and get "in" to the culture or your organization faster.
- You could break down the silos of information that naturally occur when your team gets bigger.
- You could build trust and loyalty between team members in a few minutes a week

But that's not possible, you say. Welp, the nice folks at Hallway think it is!

### That would mean
- Happier, more engaged employees
- Decreased turnover
- Employees more loyal to and trusting of their teammates

Ready to sign up? Fantastic. Right now we're working on getting our initial beta customers all lined up. If you feel like Hallway could help your team, [request a beta invite here.](/sign-up). We'll be honest...the app isn't fully built out yet, so it may be a couple of months before we're live, but it will be worth the wait. We promise. 

# Still Reading? 
Awesome! Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

## Here's everything else you need to know about Hallway. 

### Hallway allows you to:
- Jump start work relationships and find shared interests amongst coworkers
- See what your team members are like on a personal level and interact with them
- Demonstrate company culture, inside jokes, stories, and more

### Hallway won't:
- Disturb you during your most productive times
- Add to the enormous amount of meetings you already have
- Make people socialize if they don't want to

### What's the story behind hallway?
After being onboarded to a remote company, our founder found herself feeling socially isolated from the rest of her teammates. Her introversion made it uncomfortable to reach out to people she didn't know, so instead just did her work, sometimes not talking to anyone but her cat all day. 

As happy as she was to have a remote position, she still missed that small group comaraderie felt at more "traditional" jobs. As a way to improve her relationships with teammates, she built Hallway in her free time and turned a good job into a great job. After all, remote doesn't have to mean isolated.

### Who is the ideal user of Hallway?
We would describe the ideal user of Hallway as an organization having between 50 and 200 employees, with a number of teams of multiple sizes. If you have an office, some employees are not always in the office, work out of different offices or floors, and some may work remotely. You're at the point where company culture may be difficult to communicate - so it's trial-by-fire for new recruits. That being said, you would still like to keep the elements of the awesome culture that was around in the starting days of the organization and keep that same drive for growth alive and well. 

### When are you guys planning on launching?
Our goal is to get 10 good-fit customers in to our early alpha group. Once we've got a solid product, we'll release the beta version, and then open it up to the general public. To be added to the list, add yourself to the list below, or send an email to corinn@hallwayapp.com. 

### What's expected from beta users?
All we ask is of our early users and beta users is that you send us feedback on the product and alert us to any bugs you find. In exchange, you'll be able to:
- Get your opinion out there and be heard.
- Lock in your rate. It wonâ€™t go up on you. For forever.
- Be entered in our drawing to win a free lifetime subscription.

### How much is it going to cost?
We're offering special locked-in pricing of $2/user/month for teams on our beta list. We will be raising this price for the public after our beta users have put the software through its strides. 

## Sound good?
Hallway is still in development, but will be ready soon. Sign up below for early access when we're ready.
